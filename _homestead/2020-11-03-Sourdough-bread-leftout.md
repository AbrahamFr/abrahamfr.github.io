title: Sourdough bread left out overnight
---

At the end of making sourdough bread to be cooked the next day, I forgot to check the kitchen and put the bread in the refriderator for eight hours (overnight).  

So, I woke up to dough that had risen an was in an unknown state to me.  I have no idea if I saved it, but it is now cooking.  It seems to have risen during baking; but, still unknown.

I added some flour and wet my hands to add some water.  I worked the dough and then let it sit for 15 mins.  Then set the over to heat at 500 degrees for 45 minutes.  Now I am cooking it like normal.
