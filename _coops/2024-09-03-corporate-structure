title: Corporate Structure
---

Humans need to be able to organize ourselves in order to function.  From family to tribe to meighborhood to city to nation to international settings or from family to school to community to work, we need to organize 
ourselves in a way that allows for air, water, food, shelter, and society to function.  The rise of the "corporation" has been instrumental over the past 500 years as a vehicle outside of direct civil goverment
control.  From Fuedalism to Colonialism to Capitalism, the corporation has been developed and experimented with in various different forms.  Across nations, states, cities, tribes, neighborhoods, and families, 
corporations have been the most effective form of organization for specific purposes that require groups of people to work together.  The interplay between corporations pushing their agendas versus the other 
corporations and people has been the struggle of the past several centuries.  Since we have created theses amazingly powerful tools of organization, how do we balance the needs of the one and the needs of the 
many?  How do we facilitate the arena of new coporations being formaed and current corporations tranforming themselves?  How do we handle the feed back loops of action and consequence to hold coporations 
accountable as well as rewarding those that benefit others?

We have tried monarchies in Feudalism, but the king is a flawed vehicle.  We have tried Shareholder Capitalism, but the needs of the investors at the exepence of communities, employees, vendors, and the environment 
are too short sighted.  We have tried Stakeholder Capitalism to different degrees, but how much power do we give to which section of Stakeholders?
