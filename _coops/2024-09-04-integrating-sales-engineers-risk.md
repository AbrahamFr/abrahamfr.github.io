title: Integrating Sales people and Engineers with Project Management, and the risks

Sales people are terrified of an Engineer teling a Client that "we cannot do that".  The Sales person is working to understand the problem space of the Client and see how our companies products or services can help solve the customers issues.

Software Engineers are irritated by unreasonalbe or overpromised projects that did not take their expertese into consideration.  A lack of understanding the Client's problem space and the time and collaberation to find a solution causes stress.
