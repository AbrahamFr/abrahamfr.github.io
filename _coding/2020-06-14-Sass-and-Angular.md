title: SCSS and Angular
---

I am using [https://scotch.io/tutorials/using-sass-with-the-angular-cli](https://scotch.io/tutorials/using-sass-with-the-angular-cli) tuturial to remember how to do stylings with scss and Angular.

I did have to change the code a little.
```
"styles": [
  "sass/styles.scss"
],
```
to 
```
"styles": [
  "src/sass/styles.scss"
],
```
