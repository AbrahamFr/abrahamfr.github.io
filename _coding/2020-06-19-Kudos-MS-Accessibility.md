Kudos to the Visual Studio Code team at Microsoft for helping coders with tools for creating more Accessible websites!

[VS Code Accessibility](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_46#_accessibility)

> * Activity bar entries now have a `tab` role and set the appropriate `aria-expanded` state.
> * Aria labels of editors now properly convey the following editor states: `pinned`, `preview`, and `readonly`.


I particularly appreciate the above two points which shows thinking about how to help coders understand and implement Aria labels.

Although, just adding Aria to a web page does not automatically make it accessible!  We must always be thinking of how Keyboard Kevin, Screen Reader Shawna, and Grayscale Gary can use our site, not just the Typical Tina.
