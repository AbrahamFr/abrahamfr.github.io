[Express Tutorial Part 2: Creating a skeleton website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/skeleton_website)

So, I am going through this helpful tutorial.  But, I am only using the parts I need.

I did find the issue of them not using TypeScript...

`var createError = require('http-errors');`

Now I have to figure out the Import statement!
